Let me give you more knowledge and how-to.

For toasts we are using a custom component located in src/lib/components/toasts/toasts.ts

Whenever we need to display a toast we import that package
`import * as toasts from '$lib/components/toasts/toasts';`
and then do toasts.success, toasts.warning or toast.error


Another topic is translations. We have english, italian, spanish and russian translations for all text in the app. The translations are located in src/lib/translations.

Whenever I tell you to display any text, you always need to add the necessary translations to all languages and then use the getTranslation function 
`import { getTranslation } from '$lib/translations';`
