Hi there!
Please learn as much as you can about this project.
I will give you initial context, and then please get back to me with any questions you may have so I can give you all the details you need to be the best copilot for me.

So, initial contex:
This is a svelte frontend application. It is a frontend for a videos marketplace, where users can browse videos, add them to card and pay with bitcoin, and users can also upload thei videos into the system and get paid in bitcoin.

The backend API is written in go and that is another project, here we will only work in the frontend side of things.

Please take a look at the folders and files and learnas much as you can

Thanks!
